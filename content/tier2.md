#### Tier 2 â€“ Interpersonal/Between
Sympathetic Intelligence at this level is driven by a survivalist Need, Desire and Capacity to belong or be connected by the individual, but extends intelligence beyond the individual and is said to be within, between and amongst all of us. It starts with person-to-person engagement and builds to an ever-strengthening attachment with those immediately around each individual extending to a social network as we become members of groups such as partnerships, teams and communities. We first match, then connect and bond. Sympathetic Intelligence at this level becomes a multi-layered Collective phenomenon that manifests in a multitude of ways from flow states visible in teams to the vibes felt in audiences.
