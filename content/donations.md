Imagine - Itâ€™s easy if you try!

Here at the Center for Sympathetic Intelligence we believe we are forging a way forward to a better future, for what the world needs now is a more caring society.

We also believe that the human race is an intelligent species that has so far failed to realize the full potential of its deepest intelligence - the capacity to live in sympathy with each other. 

But here at the Center for Sympathetic Intelligence we imagine:

- A Society where neighborliness is the norm rather than the exception!
- A workplace where people can earn a wage without suffering an environment filled with aggression, angst and stress!
- A Health Care Industry that really cares or a corporate financial world motivated in equal part between profit and socially responsible investing!
- A police force that rarely needs to exercise authority by force in conducting their day-to-day mission of keeping the peace or a police force that can rely on the force of reason and civility alone to ensure compliance.
- A higher educational system which really puts the student as a developing human person at the center of its mission and is also a great place for  teachers, instructors and professors alike to work.
